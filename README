Introduction
============

  `dram' is a utility intended to export block content from plain-text
  files. Given a source document such as this one:

    # Say hello
  
    ## Set the message
  
    ```sh
    msg=hello
    ```
  
    ## Output the message
  
    ```sh
    echo $msg
    ```
  
  `dram' can export the block content.

    dram say_hello.md
  
    => msg=hello
    => echo $msg
  
  Exported content is written to stdout. Code can easily be executed by
  redirecting output to a file or piping it directly to a script
  interpreter.

    dram say_hello.md | /bin/sh
  
    => hello
  
  The primary use case is to provide bootstrap functionality to
  deployment or build systems by retrieving content from within
  plain-text documentation.

  `dram' only requires an AWK interpreter to run. The majority of
  environments will already provide one.

  The default configuration identifies block content based on the match
  pattern commonly used by Markdown specifications: at least three
  backticks at the beginning of a line.

  Any trailing text which appears on the same line as the pattern match
  which identified the block opening is referred to as the
  "info-string". This can be pattern matched or word searched separately
  as part of the block selection criteria.


Building and installation
=========================

  If building a development version rather than a release begin by
  running the bootstrap script. This process requires that Autoconf and
  Automake are installed.

    ./bootstrap
  
  To build referencing `gawk', `mawk', `nawk', or `awk' as the AWK
  interpreter, in that order of preference, run `configure' and then run
  `make'.

    ./configure
    make
  
  To specify the AWK binary to use instead of using the automatic search
  specify an interpreter path by setting the variable `AWK_INTERP' when
  running `configure'.

    ./configure AWK_INTERP=/usr/bin/nawk
    make
  
  Additional targets are available for running tests, installing, and
  uninstalling:

    make check
    make install
    make uninstall


Examples
========

Selection based on block ordering
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  The simplest approach to extracting code blocks from a source document
  is to do so based on the order in which they appear within the
  document.

  Given the following source document:

    # Heading
  
    ```
    one
    ```
  
    ```
    two
    ```
  
    ```
    three
    ```
  
  Output all block contents in the order they appear in the document by
  specifying no arguments:

    dram three_blocks.md
  
    => one
    => two
    => three
  
  To select specific blocks use the `blocks' argument and specify the
  target blocks based on the order in which they appear in the document.

    dram blocks='2 3' three_blocks.md
  
    => two
    => three
  
  For convenience the block selection can also be specified using commas
  to separate the values.

    dram blocks=2,3 three_blocks.md
  
    => two
    => three
  
  Negative values wrap around and can be used to select blocks relative
  to the end of the file rather than its beginning.

    dram blocks=-1,-2,-3 three_blocks.md
  
    => three
    => two
    => one
  
  The selection for block 0 is reserved for future use and does not
  return a value. Any positive or negative value which is out of range
  does not return a value.

    dram blocks=-4,0,1,4 three_blocks.md
  
    => one
  
  Strings representing a numeric range are expanded to become a sequence
  of block numbers.

    dram blocks=1-3,3-1 three_blocks.md
  
    => one
    => two
    => three
    => three
    => two
    => one


Executing code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Since content from all blocks is written to stdout the easiest way to
  execute any code stored in the the blocks is to pipe all output
  directly into stdin of a script interpreter.

  Given the follow source document:

    ```sh
    msg=hi
    ```
  
    ```sh
    echo "${msg:=hello}"
    ```
  
  The output of stdout when selecting both blocks is effectively a two
  line shell script which can be piped into a shell script interpreter:

    dram say_message.md | /bin/sh
  
    => hi
  
  The same result can be achieved by writing the output to a file and
  then executing or compiling it as a second stage:

    dram say_message.md >/tmp/script
    /bin/sh /tmp/script
  
    => hi
  
  If logic of the code is spread over multiple blocks then the selection
  criteria can be used to change the behaviour.

    dram blocks=2 say_message.md | /bin/sh
  
    => hello
  
  A simple way to modify behaviour of the code originating from a single
  block is for it to optionally use the values of environment variables.

    dram blocks=2 say_message.md | msg=goodbye /bin/sh
  
    => goodbye


Selection based on info-string words
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  It is common for the opening character sequence for a code block to
  include additional text. There is generally no fixed specification on
  how such text should be formatted or what it should represent but the
  most common usage is that the info-string consists of white-space
  separated words, with the first word representing the language used
  within the code block. Typically the language is only supplied as a
  hint to apply syntax highlighting but also works nicely to select
  blocks of scripted code and pass them to the relevant interpreter or
  compiler.

  Given the following source document:

    ```sh
    echo hello
    ```
  
    ```sh
    echo "${msg:=hello}"
    ```
  
    ```py python2 python3
    from os import getenv
    from sys import version_info
    msg = getenv('msg', 'hello')
    ```
  
    ```py python2
    for x in xrange(1, 4):
        print('%d: Python %d says %s' % (x, version_info.major, msg))
    ```
  
    ```py python3 latest
    for x in range(1, 4):
        print('{0}: Python {1} says {2}'.format(x, version_info.major, msg))
    ```
  
  Use the `words' argument to select only the blocks whose info-string
  contains the supplied words.

    dram words=sh multi_language.md | msg=goodbye /bin/sh
  
    => hello
    => goodbye
  
  Specifying more than one word will provide additional filtering to the
  selection. All the specified words must be present in the info-string
  text for the result to be classed as a match; the order in which the
  words are specified is not considered as part of the selection
  criteria. Labelling the blocks with words which indicate the script
  interpreter allows easy targeting for which blocks will be executed.

    dram words='python2 py' multi_language.md | msg=goodbye python2
  
    => 1: Python 2 says goodbye
    => 2: Python 2 says goodbye
    => 3: Python 2 says goodbye
  
  For convenience the word selection can also be specified using commas
  to separate the values.

    dram words='python3,py' multi_language.md | msg=goodbye python3
  
    => 1: Python 3 says goodbye
    => 2: Python 3 says goodbye
    => 3: Python 3 says goodbye
  
  Note that the order of the blocks in the source document and selection
  criteria are critical to result. In this instance the default ordering
  infers that the third block acts as a potential header for the code in
  the fourth and fifth blocks.

  The following would be an error since the import statements required
  by the fourth and fifth blocks haven't been passed to the interpreter.

    # an error introduced by block selection
    dram words='python3 py latest' multi_language.md | msg=goodbye python3
  
  Potential solutions to this problem could be to:
  - remove "latest" from the words argument when running the program
  - add "latest" to the info-string of the third block in the source
    document
  - remove "latest" from the info-string of the fifth block in the
    source document
  - remove the third block from the source document entirely and add the
    same content directly into the top of the two remaining python
    blocks


Selection based on info-string pattern matching
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Where selecting blocks based on an unordered word match will not be
  specific enough, or where words may be confused as a language
  identifier, a more specific block selection may be performed by
  specifying a regular expression which must find a match within the
  info-string text.

  Given the following source document:

    ```sh tcl
    echo Opening the Tcl website...
    xdg-open https://www.tcl-lang.org/
    ```
  
    ```tcl sh
    puts "sh path is '[auto_execok sh]'"
    ```
  
    ``` tcl message
    if {[catch {puts $::env(msg)}]} {
        puts hello
    }
    ```
  
  Use the `pattern' argument to specify the regular expression which
  must match a portion of the info-string line. Note that leading and
  trailing white-space of the info-string line is removed prior to the
  comparison so the pattern itself doesn't have to accommodate leading
  or trailing white-space characters.

    dram pattern=^tcl tcl.md | msg=goodbye tclsh
  
    => sh path is '/usr/bin/sh'
    => goodbye


Custom block definition length
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  By default the pattern match identifying the closing line of a block
  is required to be equal in length to the pattern match which occurred
  to open the block. This allows the same pattern plus additional
  content to appear within the block whilst keeping it opening.

  Given the following source document:

    ````
    ```
    `````
    one
    `````
    ```
    ````
  
    ```
    `````
    two
    `````
    ```
  
  The default behaviour allows `blockdef' pattern matches of different
  lengths to the match which opened the block to feature as block
  content:

    dram symetrical_blocks.md
  
    => ```
    => `````
    => one
    => `````
    => ```
    => `````
    => two
    => `````
  
  If the block definition length check is ignored by setting
  `ignoreblockdeflength' to 1 then the block may be closed early if the
  same sequence occurs within the block. For an odd number of matches
  the effect may be that leading and trailing lines which also match
  block definition are stripped from the output. For an even number of
  matches the effect may be the definition of multiple empty blocks and
  so no output is produced.

    dram ignoreblockdeflength=1 symetrical_blocks.md
  
    => one


Custom block definition pattern
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  To facilitate matching block content for formats which are dissimilar
  to Markdown the pattern used to match blocks may be customised. This
  can be particularly useful where the pattern used to a close a block
  differs from the pattern used to open the block.

  Given the following source document:

    #+begin_src sh
    echo hello
    #+end_src
  
  Setting `blockdef' to a regular expression which incorporates a match
  group allows the matching of the opening and closing of a block. Note
  that where the match length may vary between the opening and closing
  of the block the match length must also be ignored by setting
  `ignoreblockdeflength' to 1.

    dram blockdef='^#\\+(begin|end)_src' ignoreblockdeflength=1 say_hello.org | /bin/sh
  
    => hello


Reference
=========

Optional variables (arguments)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Export behaviour maybe modified by setting these variables. These are
  passed directly to the AWK interpreter and should precede any input
  filenames which are specified if they are to be in-effect.

  blockdef
        The regular expression used to match the opening and closing
        line of a block.

        If not specified the default value is "^````*" which will match
        block specifications for common Markdown implementations.

          # exactly 3 backticks only
          dram blockdef=^``` $INPUT_FILE

  ignoreblockdeflength
        Ignore the length of the pattern match which opened the block.

        By default the length of the pattern match which closes a block
        must match the length of the pattern match which was used to
        open that same block. Setting this variable to 1 will close the
        block on any line which matches the `blockdef' pattern
        irrespective of the match length. The default value is 0.

          # export Org mode source blocks
          dram blockdef='^#\\+(begin|end)_src' ignoreblockdeflength=1 $INPUT_FILE

  blocks
        Define the output order.

        By default block content is output in the order that it appears
        in the source file. By specifying a space or comma separated
        list of block numbers or strings representing a numeric range
        the ordering may be modified.

        The value of 1 represents the first block. Negative values
        select from the end of the list; -1 represents the final
        block. 0 returns nothing and is reserved for future use.

          # get the content from the first and last block
          dram blocks=1,-1 $INPUT_FILE
  
        A string representing a numeric range should take the form of
        `start-end'. Negative values for `start' or `end' are supported.

          # get the content from the first 3 blocks and last 3 blocks
          dram blocks=1-3,-3--1 $INPUT_FILE

  words
        Words which must appear in the info-string text to qualify the
        block for selection.

        By default the block is selected irrespective of info-string
        contents. By specifying a space separated list of words only
        blocks whose info-string text contains all of the specified
        words will be exported. Note that the order of the words is not
        considered.

          # export shell source blocks only and pipe to interpreter
          dram words=sh $INPUT_FILE | /bin/sh

  pattern
        A regular expression pattern which must match the info-string
        text to qualify the block for selection.

        By default the block is selected irrespective of info-string
        contents. By specifying a regular expression pattern only blocks
        whose info-string value contains a match will be exported. Note
        that leading and trailing white-space is trimmed from the
        info-string value before the match is checked.

          # export shell source blocks only and pipe to interpreter
          dram pattern=^sh $INPUT_FILE | /bin/sh

  FS
        The standard AWK variable FS is used to split the info-string
        text into words.


Processing order
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  The block selection process runs in the follow order:
  - All blocks are read
  - Blocks are selected based on the value of `blocks'
  - Blocks are deselected if the trimmed info-string text does not
    contain a match for the regular expression specified as the value of
    `pattern'
  - Blocks are deselected if the trimmed info-string text does not
    contain all of the words specified as the value of `words'


Change log
~~~~~~~~~~

Version 1.1 (2022-02-12)
------------------------

  - Add expansion of numeric ranges to block number processing

    As a convenience for specifying a sequence of block numbers, where
    the components of the blocks parameter appear to take the form of a
    numeric range this range is expanded.

    Following this change `blocks=1-3' is equivalent to `blocks=1,2,3'.

  - Enable VPATH builds for documentation files

    Initially the build targets for the documentation were only
    functional when building within the source directory. The build
    process now adjusts its working directory and the license file is
    linked into position to enable VPATH builds for the README and
    ChangeLog files.

    This allows the "distcheck" target to run in VPATH builds.

  - Switch tests to use Test Anything Protocol

    The included test scripts have been modified to produce output which
    should conform to version 12 of the Test Anything Protocol (TAP)
    Specification. The output of the test scripts is read by a TAP
    consumer supplied as part of GNU Automake. As part of this change
    the expected and observed outputs of each test are no longer written
    to disk and compared with the `diff' utility, instead these values
    are kept as strings and compared within the testing script. The
    observed output of the test is emitted from each test as a sequence
    of TAP diagnostic lines.

    Following these changes:

    - To view the observed output of every test as it runs modify the
      environment variable `TEST_LOG_DRIVER_FLAGS' to include the option
      "--comments".

        TEST_LOG_DRIVER_FLAGS=--comments make check

    - Alternative TAP consumers can be used by spooling the test script
      output or the Automake test logs through them.

        tests/01-block_order.test | tappy
        find tests -name '*.log' -exec tappy '{}' \;

    - Tests now pass when running on Windows with MSYS2 since there is
      no longer a potential conflict between line ending style on MSYS2
      utility output and the line ending style of files representing the
      correct result.

  - Clarify the usage of commas in variable values

    The usage of commas to delimit the values of the `words' parameter
    was not explicitly stated. The documentation has been updated to
    confirm that this usage is valid and provide an example which uses
    this feature.


Version 1.0 (2021-08-20)
