Version 1.1 (2022-02-12)
========================

  - Add expansion of numeric ranges to block number processing

    As a convenience for specifying a sequence of block numbers, where
    the components of the blocks parameter appear to take the form of a
    numeric range this range is expanded.

    Following this change `blocks=1-3' is equivalent to `blocks=1,2,3'.

  - Enable VPATH builds for documentation files

    Initially the build targets for the documentation were only
    functional when building within the source directory. The build
    process now adjusts its working directory and the license file is
    linked into position to enable VPATH builds for the README and
    ChangeLog files.

    This allows the "distcheck" target to run in VPATH builds.

  - Switch tests to use Test Anything Protocol

    The included test scripts have been modified to produce output which
    should conform to version 12 of the Test Anything Protocol (TAP)
    Specification. The output of the test scripts is read by a TAP
    consumer supplied as part of GNU Automake. As part of this change
    the expected and observed outputs of each test are no longer written
    to disk and compared with the `diff' utility, instead these values
    are kept as strings and compared within the testing script. The
    observed output of the test is emitted from each test as a sequence
    of TAP diagnostic lines.

    Following these changes:

    - To view the observed output of every test as it runs modify the
      environment variable `TEST_LOG_DRIVER_FLAGS' to include the option
      "--comments".

        TEST_LOG_DRIVER_FLAGS=--comments make check

    - Alternative TAP consumers can be used by spooling the test script
      output or the Automake test logs through them.

        tests/01-block_order.test | tappy
        find tests -name '*.log' -exec tappy '{}' \;

    - Tests now pass when running on Windows with MSYS2 since there is
      no longer a potential conflict between line ending style on MSYS2
      utility output and the line ending style of files representing the
      correct result.

  - Clarify the usage of commas in variable values

    The usage of commas to delimit the values of the `words' parameter
    was not explicitly stated. The documentation has been updated to
    confirm that this usage is valid and provide an example which uses
    this feature.
